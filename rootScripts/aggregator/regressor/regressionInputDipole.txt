Global flag                               (Leaf to be used as global cut error code)
Speed 0.66                                (Relative correction amount per fit pass, last pass always has speed = 1)
Fit-Type dipole                           (parity/linear, dipole)
Non-Linear-Fit 1.0                        (Non linear fit = 1.0, depends on the uncertainties too, and it needs more than one pass to get the parameter uncertainties and to converge)
Fit-Pass-Limit 100                        (Only calculate the new parameters once = 1, if this number is large then either the fit will meet criteria below or will stop at the limit)
Fit-Stability-Criteria 0.01               (If all of the parameters change by less than this factor then the fit has converged into a local Chi^2 x-imum)
Fit-Runaway-Scale-RMS-Criteria 0.0000001  (If all of the parameters relative change scale factor fall in a distribution with this RMS then rescale them down by 1e6)
Fit-Runaway-Scale-Value-Criteria 2.0      (If all of the parameters meet above criteria and avg change scale factor is above this number then rescale them down by 1e6)
