   CODA Classes
   ============

R. Michaels, October 2001

These classes are layers on top of the standard CODA
libraries 'evio' and 'ET'.  The purposes are:

1. To provide an abstract interfaces so that methods
   that open, read, and close a CODA file look the same
   as for an ET connection.  This allows dynamic binding.

2. To hide implementation details, and provide clear
   error messages.  From a large choice of usages of ET
   we choose a preferred mode where each user obtains
   an independent sample of events from anywhere on
   the network and cannot cause deadtime.

     README  -- this file
     Makefile  -- to compile, type 'make'
                  It was tested on Linux RedHat 6.2 
                  and SunOS in the ADAQ environment.

 CODA Classes by R. Michaels

     THaCodaData.C    -- abstract class
     THaCodaData.h

     THaCodaFile.C    -- a file of CODA data
     THaCodaFile.h

     THaEtClient.C    -- an ET connection
     THaEtClient.h

  Test codes
     tstcoda_main.C  -- the most interesting one, tests abstract interface
     tstcoda_main_brief.C  -- a briefer version of tstcoda.
     etclient_main.C
     etclient_main_nonptr.C   -- uses ET class 
     etclient_main_ptr.C      -- same, but uses pointer to class
     tstio_main.C             -- read a CODA file

  EVIO and ET stuff from CODA group (mostly untouched, updated Oct 2001)

     et.h
     evio.C
     evio.h
     swap_util.C
     libevio.a      Evio library (compile with 'make libevio.a')
                    This library can be used elsewhere, e.g. for
                    the parity analyzer.  Just copy it where you need it.
