! 70 uA running BCM, BPM tracking non-saturation, global promotion of device error codes, BPM 4aYM had a few runs with strange wire response due to poor BNC connection
! So far stability cut on bcm_an_ds was 0.8. As we decided in WAC meeting 07/24/2019, we make the cut 1.4 for 70uA and 1 for 50uA running. i.e 2% stability cut. - Also changing to DG ds to mitigate noise

!IMPORTANT
!---------
!Make sure when puting tabs in the map file entries, always put ", " before inserting a tab. 
!Otherwise the routine QwParameterFile::GetNextToken(", ") will extract the entry with the tab character.

!Comments
!--------
!Devices that are not in the list are not subjected event cut checks
!All devices  will be tested for HW checks.
!
!For device_type =bcm only upper and lower limit of the calibrated charge on the ADC HW sum. (QwVQWK_Channel::fHardwareBlockSum)
