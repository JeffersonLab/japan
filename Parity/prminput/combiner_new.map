# Rules for this file
# - no repeating dependent variables in the same section
#   (probably also not in different sections, come to think of it)
#
# - Alias names start with "@" after the "asym" or "diff" prefix.
#   They should also be all lower case.
#

# Double differences

## This is a simple case:
##  two dependent variables
##  two independent variables
#[asym:qwk_md1neg, asym:qwk_md1pos]
#diff:x_targ, 0.0, -0.0
#diff:y_targ, 0.0, -0.0
#
##  four independent variables
##  asymmetry for dependent variables
#[asym:qwk_md2neg, asym:qwk_md2pos]
#diff:x_targ, 0.11, -0.11
#diff:y_targ, 0.12, -0.12
