 * \section unitsoverview Units in the QwAnalysis framework
 *
 * As more and more analyzers start contributing code to the Qweak analysis
 * code, it is important to use some conventions to avoid confusion.  One of
 * the conventions is the use of a standard system of coordinates.  The other
 * is a unified set of units.  This way we will avoid errors when angles are
 * not converted from degrees to radians, or centimeters and inches are in
 * mixed up.
 *
 * The basic units in the QwAnalysis framework are:
 * \li Length: <b>cm</b>
 * \li Time: <b>ms</b>
 * \li Energy: <b>MeV</b>
 * \li Angles: <b>rad</b>
 * \li Magnetic field: <b>T</b>
 *
 * How are these units to be used?  Any variable that is being used inside
 * subsystems and <b>especially when passing information to other subsystems</b>
 * should have values in these units.
 *
 * This does not mean that every single constant has to be defined in these
 * units, or that output has to use these units.  A set of conversion constants
 * is defined to make life easier.
 *
 * Take as an example the magnetic field map.  The values stored in the map file
 * by the external program are in kG.  To convert those values, we would write:
 * \code
 * double bx, by, bz;
 * mapfile >> bx >> by >> bz; // read values
 * bx *= Qw::kG; by *= Qw::kG; bz *= Qw::kG; // define the units (kG)
 * \endcode
 * From now on, the values in bx, by, bz are in standard Qweak units (T).  To
 * write out the values in Gauss we write:
 * \code
 * cout << bx/Qw::G << "," << by/Qw::G << "," << bz/Qw::G << " G" << endl;
 * \endcode
 * For Tesla we would write
 * \code
 * cout << bx/Qw::T << "," << by/Qw::T << "," << bz/Qw::T << " T" << endl;
 * \endcode
 *
 * If there are hard-coded values in the analyzer (which should be avoided),
 * we should use these units to define them:
 * \code
 * const double position_r3 = 398.8 * Qw::cm;
 * const double helicity_window = 1.0 * Qw::ms;
 * const double noise_frequency = 60.0 * Qw::Hz;
 * \endcode
