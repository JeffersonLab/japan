The Qweak analysis package depends upon a few external software packages,
and they must be installed before you can compile this package.  They
are:
  	* ROOT
	  See http://root.cern.ch/ for downloads.
	  The analyzer has been tested with versions 5.08-00, and 5.12.00.

	* Boost Libraries
	  See http://www.boost.org/ for downloads of the source packages,
	  or an rpm distributor for your OS or precompiled packages.
	  Note that if you get the precompiled rpms, you will probably
	  need both "boost" and "boost-devel" rpms, depending on how
	  the packager has broken up the files.
	  The analyzer has been tested with versions 1.32.0 and 1.33.1
	  of the Boost libraries.

	* MySQL.

This package has been tested to compile with gcc-4.8.5.
If you encounter compilation problems please send me a message describing
what problems you encountered, and what compiler you were using.


COMPILATION:
This package has been written to use cmake, and has been tested with
cmake-2.8.12.2.

To compile the standard executables, do:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../
	make
The executables will be left in the "build" subdirectory.

You may also run "make install" from the build directory, to put the
executables in "bin/" and the libraries in "lib/".

A target "make uninstall" will remove the installed executables and
libraries from "bin/" and "lib/".


PACKAGE LAYOUT:
The GNUMakefile is expecting a certain structure to the subdirectories
and uses that to perform the compilation configuration.
In each subdirectory containing package source files, there will be
four subdirectories:
	src
	include
	main
	prminputs
All paths like "*/include" will be included in the header file search
path.  The files in the "*/main" subdirectories will be interpreted
as corresponding to an executable.  If you add a new file in a "main"
subdirectory, you can enable compilation of it using the "gmake config"
step outlined above.
All files in the src directories are interpreted as the source files.
The source files to be compiled are explicitly listed in the CMakeLists.txt
file.  This enables easy addition or modification of file dependencies.




There are several subdirectories within the package:
	coda
		This contains the CODA interface classes written
		for Hall A and found in the pan distribution.
		These are responsible for interfacing with CODA
		format data files, or with the ET event stream 
		for online analysis.
		As this is a copy of the Hall A subpackage, it
		does not follow the package layout conventions,
		and it has its own Makefile.

	Analysis
		This directory contains the basic classes of the
		QwAnalysis engine.  This includes a event handler
		class which can be configured to draw data from
		file of event stream, and several base classes
		used as the framework for the specialized 
		analyzers.
		Subdirectories are:
			src
			include
			main
			prminputs

	bin
	lib
		These will contain the executable and shared library 
		files after compilation.
	SetupFiles
		This contains scripts used in the configuration of
		the environment used for compilation and running
		the package.
