! 12-02-2010  B.Waidyawansa  Added the correct offset in Z to the target (+11mm->moved downstream). 
!                            Removed the wrong offser of 14mm in X. It was meant to be the offset for Z not X.
!                            I got confused. Greg said 14mm offset to Z. Survey doc (http://www.jlab.org/accel/survalign/documents/dthallc/C1340.pdf)
!                            shows it was 11mm offset to z compared to the old value from the last survey (http://www.jlab.org/accel/survalign/documents/dthallc/C1307.pdf).
!                            So I used that value instead.
!
! 11-12-2010  B.Waidyawansa  Added the new surveyed offsets for the 3 bpms in front of the target from 
!                            Jays hclog https://hallcweb.jlab.org/hclog/1011_archive/101112150143.html
!
! X/Yoffset - The difference in the ideal position and the surveyed position of a BPM in X/Y axis.
!
! Z offset  - The location of the BPM in the hallC beamline (alog Z axis) from the begining of the arc
!             to the center of the device/ origin of device coordinate system.
!
! BSEN scaling factor - Bpm SENsitivity scaling factor is the ratio of general BSEN = 18.81 adc counts/mm 
!                       seen in most of the BPMs in the hall and the actual BSEN of a BPM. 
!                       Almost all the BPMs in the hallC beamline except 3H08 has BSEN=25.8 adc counts/mm
!                       So we use this factor to apply such changes.
!
! AlphaX/Y  - Relative gains of the individual XM,YM pairs compared to XP,YP pairs.
! 
! The units of the offsets are in millemeters to be comparable with the units of the analysis results.
!
! The optime based BPM and target offset values for bpms after 3c19 were obtained from Qweak-doc-1203-v3 bu Nuruzzaman.
! The BSEN, ALPHAX and ALPHAY values and the XSOF and YSOF values for the rest of the bpms were obtained from EPICS.
!
! For BPMs that don't have factors or offsets given in the list below, default values will
! be assigned. 
!   default  offset (X/Y/Z) = 0.0
!   default BSEN scaling factor = 18.81
!   default AlphaX/AlphaY = 1.0

! The representative bpm for qweak hydrogen target.
! From the latest survey information on target (http://www.jlab.org/accel/survalign/documents/dthallc/C1340.pdf),
! the dz offset for the target was reduced 11 mm by moving the target by 11 mm downstream.
! Therefore I added the new z offset ,11 mm to the ideal z position of the target ( 148739 mm ) to get the correct center of the
! target w.r.t  bpm coordinates.
